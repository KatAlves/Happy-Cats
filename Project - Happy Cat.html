        <strong>â‹‡ Give your cat plenty of loving attention </strong><br />
        Some people assume that cats are self-sufficient and that they are just
        fine spending time on their own. But even if they donâ€™t mind spending
        time by themselves, they still want you to keep them company and give
        them attention on a daily basis. Cuddle and snuggle with your cat every
        day, play with your furry friend and pet them on their favorite spots!
      </li>
      <hr />
      <li>
        <strong>â‹‡ Provide entertainment </strong><br />
        Cats are independent animals and will cope well when youâ€™re at work. You
        can, however, make sure that they have enough toys to keep busy. You can
        buy cat toys in most pet shops and supermarkets. When you come home,
        donâ€™t forget to play! Cats need exercise.
      </li>
      <hr />
      <li>
        <strong>â‹‡ Refresh Your Catâ€™s Water/Food Dish & Litter </strong><br />
        Water is essential for your catâ€™s health and happiness. They're eating
        places should always be cleaned to prevent bacteria and diseases. Cats
        are really clean by nature so, they don't like bad smells, they will
        thank you if you take care of their litter on a daily basis and change
        the sand regularly.
      </li>
      <hr />
      <li>
        <strong>â‹‡ Treat Your Cat with Treats & Good Food </strong><br />
        Cats enjoy treats just as much as the next pet, so treat your cat by
        getting them a new treat thatâ€™s not only healthy but also delicious and
        low in calories. And of course, don't forget to choose an adequate cat
        food with healty indredients making sure you feed your cat with natural
        cat food, one designed to support lifelong physical, mental and
        emotional feline health.
      </li>
      <hr />
      <li>
        <strong>â‹‡ Plant a Patch of Cat Grass </strong><br />
        If youâ€™ve ever seen your cat try to nibble the leaves of your favorite
        fichus or the blooms of fresh-cut flowers, itâ€™s because theyâ€™ve got a
        natural instinct to nosh on grass. Grass fibers help them with digestion
        among other things. Cat grass is actually easy to grow indoors and
        outdoors and is a definite treat for kitties.
